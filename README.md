🧸 Daycare Management System
A multi-tenant daycare management application built with React + TypeScript, Express, and SQLite, designed to help daycare centers manage children, parents, payments, and risk profiles — while allowing a central admin to oversee the entire ecosystem.
This project demonstrates real-world SaaS architecture, role-based access control, and data integrity across tenants.

🚀 Key Features
🔐 Authentication & Roles
•	Secure login system (local authentication)
•	Role-based access control:
o	Admin: Full access across all daycares
o	Daycare User: Restricted to their own daycare’s data
🏫 Multi-Tenant Architecture

•	Link children to parents and specific daycares
•	Prevent non-paying or flagged parents from re-registering at new daycares
💳 Payments & Risk Tracking

📊 Admin Oversight
•	Admin dashboard with system-wide visibility
•	Add and manage daycare centers
•	View data across all tenants while preserving isolation
